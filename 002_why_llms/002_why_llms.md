2. increase ROI

- faster software development
- users can levarage AI
- use cases
- reduce development costs
- reduce monotonous tasks

## The Gap 

the ceo says "we need to add LLMs", this have 3 big gap points : (gap points for "where do we start ?")
we can get into base theory/algo Or we start building and customizing our LLM Or we use some third party black box SAAS LLM API.

1. Base theory/Algorithm : Academic
2. Build your own
3. black box solution

> Criterias in choosing LLM

1. Model Quality
   1. is there a llm out there that is of high quality
   2. Or I have a way to improve it for myself.
2. Serving Cost
   1. its cost of running model and getting output.
3. Serving Latency
   1. if it an offline analysis it is fine, else it must be better in latency.
4. Customizability
   1. we need to know how it is doing things, monitor them and controlling the behaviour.
